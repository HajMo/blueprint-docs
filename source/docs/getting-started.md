## Getting Started
_Blueprint_ is an open-source tool for **rapidly generating multiple** Laravel components from a **single, human readable** definition.

Blueprint has two driving principles:

1. Increase development speed
2. Promote Laravel conventions

### Requirements
Blueprint requires a Laravel application running version 6.0 or higher.

While Blueprint may be more flexible in a future version, it currently assumes a standard project structure using the default `App` namespace.
