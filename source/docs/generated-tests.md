## Generated Tests
For any control or action generated by blueprint, blueprint will also generate an [HTTP test](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/http-tests).

This test will be complete with the three main sections of a test.

The arrange section which will set up any model factories used by the test as well as fake any of the underlying for sans used with in the control her actions.

Next an act section which will send the HTTP we quest to the appropriate route with any parameters and request data.

And finally and assert section to verify the response as well as any behavior on the marked objects.

Well these tests are generated to be runnable out of the box, You should always review them to strengthen them as you customize the generated code.ï¿¼
